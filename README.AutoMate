Short guide to build packages in AutoMate
=========================================

Build source package
--------------------

Enter in the package folder.

    $ cd mate-terminal/

If needed, add an entry to changelog.
Add ~devX to the version if it's a development build.

    $ dch -i

Get the orig tarball:

    $ debian/rules get-orig-source

Or, if it's a devel build, just archive your source and rename it as
follow (be sure to remove .git folder from tarball, to reduce size):

    mate-terminal_1.2.1.orig.tar.xz

Build the source package:

    $ debuild -S -sa

Send package to AutoMate server
-------------------------------

Add those lines to your ~/.dput.cf

[automate]
fqdn = automate.mate-desktop.org
method = ftp
login = anonymous
incoming = /upload/

Send package with dput:

    $ dput automate mate-terminal_1.2.1-1_source.changes

You should receive an email if the package is accepted and verified.
