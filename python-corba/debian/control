Description: A Python language binding for the ORBit2 MATECORBA implementation
 It aims to take advantage of new features found in ORBit2 to make
 language bindings more efficient.  This includes:
   - Use of ORBit2 type libraries to generate stubs
   - use of the ORBit_small_invoke_stub() call for operation
     invocation, which allows for short circuited invocation on local
     objects.
 .
 Where it makes sense, this binding tries to stay compatible with the
 Python language mapping, which can be found on the OMG web site:
