Description: MATE configuration database system (support tools)
 mate-conf is a configuration database system for storing application
 preferences. It supports default or mandatory settings set by the
 administrator, and changes to the database are instantly applied to all
 running applications. It is written for the MATE desktop but doesn't
 require it.
